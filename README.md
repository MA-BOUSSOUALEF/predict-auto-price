## Project Overview

This project is an **interactive web application** designed to predict the price of a car based on its specifications. The application consists of two main components: a **Flask API** backend and a **frontend HTML form** that allows users to input various car features. Using these inputs, the backend predicts the car's price using a pre-trained machine learning model deployed on **Azure Machine Learning**.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: A user-friendly form where users input car details such as make, model, fuel type, engine specifications, etc.
- **Real-time Price Prediction**: The car price is predicted immediately after the user submits the form with the car's details.
- **Azure Machine Learning Model Integration**: The backend integrates with a pre-trained machine learning model deployed on Azure Machine Learning for price prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework used for creating the backend API.
- **Python**: For processing data, interacting with the machine learning model, and serving the API.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user input and sending the data to the Flask backend.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating and styling the user interface.
- **Azure Machine Learning**: Deployed machine learning model on Azure for predicting car prices.
- **Azure API Management**: If applicable, used for exposing the machine learning model as an API.
- **Machine Learning**: A pre-trained machine learning model on Azure that predicts car prices based on the input features.
